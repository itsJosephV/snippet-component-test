### Tailwind Snippets - study
This project is built upon the work of [Alexandru Å¢urcanu](https://alexandru.so)'s Snippets site and [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski) original work. Credits goes to both of them for their contributions to my learning journey and inspiration.


#### Purpose
This project was built to put into practice my TypeScript skills after taking this amazing course ðŸ‘‰ [totaltypescript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript) and to figure out how to work with RadixUI primitives components, all this was possible after spending a few hours studying Alexandru Å¢urcanu's code structure & and the techs he used for it.

Additionaly, I would like to extend credits to [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me), I discovered him two weeks ago and I was fascinated with the simplicity of his personal site, I find beauty in it so I decided to use some of his layout.

IMPORTANT: Do not check how much is the font Paco is using there. ðŸ’€
